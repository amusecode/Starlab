Some issues for starlab4
------------------------


- use flags in a consistent way, such that -I and -L additions are not needed
  in the makefiles. In particular, linking X11 application in starlab3 has:
	-L$(STARLAB_X11LIB) -lX11 $(STARLAB_XLIB)
  and I needed to make it
	$(STARLAB_X11LIB) $(STARLAB_XLIB)

- to solve the makefile.SITE issue in src/node/dyn/hdyn/util and
  src/node/dyn/hdyn/evolve i suggest we use a SITE variable in the makefile,
  look at the Makefile's config_new target. In general, we could also solve
  this using two STARLAB_GRAPE_* variables? See cshrc.starlab.in for comments.

- update TOOLS
	
- use of the CPP preprocessor is only guarenteed for .c files... we use .F
  but i've seen  for gnu
	cpp file.F > file.f
  and for others i also saw
	cpp file.F file.f
  (which does not work for gnu)
  Or is the -E or -P flag the trick here. At any rate,need to figure out a consistent
  syntax.

- remove redundancies in Makefile's by using a 'makedefs' file that can be
  included
