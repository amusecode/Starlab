	***** NOTES to Redhat Linux users (and others)! *****

1.  Some of the scripts in this directory fail under tcsh unless the
first line explicitly specifies the use of tcsh, e.g. by

#/bin/tcsh -f

i.e. tcsh must be used instead of csh.  This problem apparently only
occurs in Redhat LINUX, version 4 -- /bin/csh has been OK for every
other OS tried. (Note the arbitrary choice of location for tcsh,
incidentally.)

    The reason for this problem is unclear, as are the circumstances
under which it occurs.  Make has been known to fail suddenly when only
the Starlab version ID is changed!  However, all make-related scripts
are suspect; the following files are potentially affected by this
problem:

	makewalk
	makewalk.quiet
	make_ar_cleanup
	make_cond_build
	make_cond_compile
	make_list_files
	make_touch_src

Currently, we know of no alternative to simply editing the files in
order to switch back and forth between shells (e.g. for systems
without tcsh).  The (csh) script change_shell automates this process.
The command

	change_shells_list  /bin/tcsh  /bin/csh

will edit the above-named files to replace the standard /bin/tcsh by
/bin/csh instead.  This script may also be used to change the location
of tcsh.

2.  More generally, the locations of both tcsh and csh may differ from
system to system.  Accordingly, we adopt the following convention:

	(i)   Scripts that are known to need tcsh (for whatever reason)
	      on some systems are headed by #!/bin/tcsh -f.  If this
	      location for tcsh is not correct, change it using the
	      command

		    change_shells_list  /bin/tcsh  new-tcsh

	(ii)  Possibly a better way to reset these files to the standard
	      /bin/tcsh or some other shell is to use

		    reset_list
	      or
		    reset_list  new-tcsh

	     to use tcsh in some other location.

	(iii) All other scripts are headed by #!/bin/csh -f.  Should
	      csh reside somewhere else, you can perform a global edit
	      on all scripts using change_shell:

		    change_shell  old-shell  new-shell  file(s)

	      It should be OK to perform this operation on all files
	      with

		    change_shell  old-shell  new-shell  *

	In all cases, originals of all modified files are stored in
	the subdirectory .save.
