Kira parameters stored in the input snapshot
--------------------------------------------

initial_mass

	Defines the run's initial mass (in N-body units).
	May be set by mk*, scale, or kira.

initial_rvirial

	Defines the run's initial virial radius (in N-body units).
	May be set by mk*, scale, or kira.

initial_rtidal_over_rvirial

	Defines the initial "tidal" radius of the system.
	Used by kira in initial determination of tidal parameters.
	Set by mk*king.

kira_initial_jacobi_radius

	Defines the initial Jacobi radius, as determined by kira.
	Used by kira for restart.  Overrides any command-line input.
	Set by kira.

alpha3_over_alpha1

	Defines the form of the tidal field (point-mass ==> -1/3).
	Used by kira to determine tidal parameters.
	Set by mk_aniso_king.

kira_scaled_stripping_radius

	Defines the scaled stripping radius, as determined by kira.
	Used by kira for restart.  Overrides any command-line input.
	Set by kira.
