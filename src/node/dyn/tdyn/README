* The tools in this directory as of Dec 2003 were very redundant in
  operation, and not obvious in their naming.  They can be found in
  subdirectory dec-2003.  The (modified) survivors are listed in the
  Makefile, and are described below:

    print_id		print out the standard worldline ID
			corresponding to the command-line argument

    scanbinary		read a collection of worldbundles, then prompt
			for the name of a particle or node and print
			out its interaction history (as defined by
			changes in the tree structure)

    scanbundle		read and print statistics on a series of
			worldbundles

    xstarplot22		graphical display of worldbundle data (uses
			the NEW	interpolation functions)

    worldlines		read a worldbundle and print snapshots at
			selected times

* Also:

    tdyn_io		test driver for library functions; not for use
			as a tool

    worldline2		read in a worldbundle, output a pdyn snapshot
			at some time; new interpolation scheme; not
			for use as a tool -- functionality superceded
			by worldlines
