Worldline To Do List (Steve, 10/20/00)
--------------------------------------

1. How to handle output from binaries -- bound systems produce too
   much data!  Better to treat all but the most strongly perturbed
   binaries as kepler objects, retaining the possibility that the
   kepler parameters may vary along a segment.  Threshhold for this
   treatment?  How to ensure continuity?

2. How to manage simultaneous disk I/O and computation, using shared
   memory?
