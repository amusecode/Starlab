Installation procedes in GNU standard way:

	./configure --prefix=install-dir
	make
	make install

See the INSTALL file in this directory for more information.

However, Starlab now makes heavy use of the "autotools" aucoconf,
automake, and libtool.  Unless you are sure that your system has
versions of these tools newer than those used to build the package,
you probably first will want to install the autotools found in
src/packages.  You can do this by hand, or run the script

	install-autotools

found in that directory.

If you prefer to install everything automatically, run the script

	developer-install-starlab

in this directory.
