- see the README file in "doc/README".  Specifically, we reserve
  the right of initial co-authorship for any publication in which
  3-body scattering programs are used (in .../hdyn/sdyn3/scatter3),
  in the same spirit as discussed in doc/README under item 3.
  Similar considerations apply (for now) to the kira software in
  hdyn.
