README:

- We assume that the variable STARLAB_PATH points to the top-level
  installation directory (i.e. the one containing this file).

- Installation proceeds in GNU standard way:

	./configure --prefix=install-dir
	make
	make install

  See the INSTALL file in this directory for more information.  The
  current default install-dir is

	$STARLAB_PATH/usr.

- However, Starlab now makes heavy use of GNU "autotools," namely
  aucoconf, automake, and libtool.  Unless you are sure that your
  system has versions of these tools newer than those used to build
  the package, you probably first will want to install the autotools
  found in $STARLAB_PATH/src/packages.  You can do this by hand, or
  run the script

	install-autotools

  found in that directory.  You will also have to modify your search
  path to ensure that the directory containing the newly installed
  autotools *precedes* any system directory before proceeding with
  the Starlab installation.

- If you prefer to install everything automatically, run the script

	developer-install-starlab

  in this directory.  This script basically performs the actions just
  described, but it also provides timing information and attempts to
  clean up the "make" output.

- Once the package is successfully installed, to use the Starlab tools,
  make sure that the directory

        $install_dir/bin

  is in your search path, preceding any system files.  You may also
  find it useful to include the Starlab administrative directory

	$STARLAB_PATH/sbin

- For programmers, the Starlab header files are installed in

        $install_dir/include/starlab

  and the libraries are in

        $install_dir/lib/starlab

  If the autotools are properly installed, developers should find that
  any changes made to the automake "Makefile.am" files will cause the
  relevant Makefiles to be automagically regenerated.
