README:

- We assume that the variable STARLAB_PATH points to the top-level
  installation directory (i.e. the one containing this file).  GRAPE
  users should read the GRAPE section below before starting the
  configure/build process.

- Installation proceeds in GNU standard way:

	./configure --prefix=install-dir --other-options
	make
	make install

  See the INSTALL file in this directory for more information.  The
  current default install-dir is

	$STARLAB_PATH/usr

- However, Starlab now makes heavy use of GNU "autotools," namely
  aucoconf, automake, and libtool.  Unless you are sure that your
  system has versions of these tools newer than those used to build
  the package, you probably first will want to install the autotools
  found in $STARLAB_PATH/src/packages.  You can do this by hand, or
  run the script

	install-autotools

  found in that directory.  You will also have to modify your search
  path to ensure that the directory containing the newly installed
  autotools *precedes* any system directory before proceeding with
  the Starlab installation.

- If you prefer to install everything automatically, run the script

	developer-install-starlab

  in this directory.  This script basically performs the actions just
  described, but it also provides timing information and attempts to
  clean up the "make" output.

- Once the package is successfully installed, to use the Starlab tools,
  make sure that the directory

        $install_dir/bin

  is in your search path, preceding any system files.  You may also
  find it useful to include the Starlab administrative directory

	$STARLAB_PATH/sbin


GRAPE SYSTEMS:

- It is very difficult for the configure script to infer automatically
  the existence of a GRAPE or to determine the appropriate GRAPE
  libraries and other settings to use.  If you have a GRAPE, you will
  have to place that information in the file

	$STARLAB_PATH/local/grape.sh

  This file is a simple shell script that sets a few variables used
  to build the Makefiles.  So that it cannot be overwritten by a new
  release after you have created it, the script itself is not distributed
  with the Starlab package.  However, a template is distributed in

	$STARLAB_PATH/local/grape.sh.template

  and a collection of examples from various GRAPE sites is contained
  in

	$STARLAB_PATH/local/grape.sh.examples

  You will have to rerun configure after creating or changing this
  script, so you will probably want to make these changes BEFORE building
  the system!  If you don't have a GRAPE, do nothing, and Starlab will
  by default build a system without GRAPE acceleration.
  

PROGRAMMERS:

- For programmers, the Starlab header files are installed in

        $install_dir/include/starlab

  and the libraries are in

        $install_dir/lib/starlab

- If the autotools are properly installed, developers should find that
  any changes made to the automake "Makefile.am" files will cause the
  relevant Makefiles to be automagically regenerated.

- If you change any of the m4 macros in $STARLAB_PATH/local (e.g. to
  use a different GRAPE library) or if you modify the configure.ac
  script in $STARLAB_PATH, you *MUST* run autoreconf before running
  configure again.
